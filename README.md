# Study Pal - Your Personalised Study Tracker 

Study Pal is a fullstack application targeting students studying in a class based or online set-up.  
The Study-Pal application was created to assist students in the organisation of subjects and notes, so each student can keep track of their subjects and topics within these subjects. 
The target audience, being studets, are able to create subjects and topics within one page and track their study by ticking off each subject as they complete. In another page, students are able to create, update and delete notes.

 ## **User Experience**
---
### **User stories**
- As a vistior to the site I want to have a clear idea of the applications purpose upon visiting the site.
- As a student I would like to be able to create my own account
- As a student I want to view my personalised modules/notes on a daily/weekly basis
- As a student, I want to be able to create notes based on any subject I have on my courseload.
- As a student, I want to be able to track what topics I have studied and am yet to complete.
- As a student I want to be able to remove topics and subjects at the end of studies so i can start over again.
- As a student, I want to be able to edit and delete notes as I work through these also.
- As a student I want to be able to mark off what lessons Iâ€™ve completed as I progress on the courseload

- As an instructor, I would like to be able to view a students account using their @edu email address to view their study progress.

### Design
The overall design idea behind this was accessible.  I wanted to make Study-Pal an accessible planner, for both young students and old and allow course mentors view their students progress, by simply inputting the students email address into the login page. 

### Framework
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Bootstrap useage largely focuses on the responsiveness aspect of the appliaction

[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
- Materialize used for the general forms due to the clean and simple appearence. 

[JQuery v3.5.1](https://jquery.com/)
- In an bid to keep the JavaScript usage minimal, I chose to use jQuery as foundation to my scripts framework.

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
- Flask is a microframework that I've used to render the back-end Python with the front-end.


Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
